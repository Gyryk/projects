# Projects
## A simple website to show off my entire portfolio of projects

There are some projects that no longer represent my current Web Design/Software Development capabilities, however, I have chosen to keep them on this website regardless for now.
<br>
Currently, the portfolio simply takes you to the project being referenced but in the future, I will be adding some more information <br>
>  One possibility is a hover effect that also shows the technologies utilized for the project. <br> Another is that I take you to a new page where I give you a more detailed breakdown of the project. The latter is more tedious but the former is more technically challenging given the current structure of the code.

#### The website is live at http://projects.gyryk.com/

#### In the future, you can expect the tools used and/or information about the development progress on this website.
