# Projects
#### A simple website to show off my entire portfolio of projects
- There aren't that many projects added at the moment but I'll keep working on that

Currently the portfolio simply takes you to the project being referenced but in the future I will be adding some more information that is shown when you click on them instead of it just taking you away to a different website. <br>
> It's going to take a lot of time to input all of that data and program something cool to show it all off so for now this is where it's at :(

#### In the future, you can expect more photos in a carousel type format, the tools used, and information about the development progress along with the link to the project
